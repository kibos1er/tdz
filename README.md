# TDZ

This package contains the data files of the game TDZ (Tower Defense Zelda).
This game is free and open-source. It works with [Solarus](https://github.com/christopho/solarus),
an open-source Zelda-like 2D game engine.
To play this game, you need Solarus.
We assume in this readme that Solarus is already installed.

Most of the resources used come from zsdx (https://github.com/christopho/zsdx).

See the [development blog](http://www.solarus-games.org) to get more
information and documentation about Solarus.
